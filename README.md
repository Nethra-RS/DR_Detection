Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy 
• Developed and implemented a Diabetic Retinopathy detection system using ResNet-50.
• Preprocessed and augmented fundus images using Python, Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 to improve model performance.
• Deployed the model using Streamlit on cloud platforms.
• Achieved 97.4% and 98.26% accuracy on training and validation datasets in classifying the retinal images into 5 categories.
